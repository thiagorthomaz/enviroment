# Enviroment

I started this small project to practice my Shell script habilities. It will set up a LAMP development enviroment on a Ubuntu flavor.

Requirement:
 - Ubuntu 16.04+

See what this script will do:

 - Verify and fix your /var/www/html permissions;
 - Inform you PHP, Apache and MySQL Version;
 - Install PHP and Apache with modules. Install MySQL.
